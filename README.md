# Instant Summons
Note: this Chrome extension no longer works after the [Owlbear 2.0 Update](https://blog.owlbear.rodeo/owlbear-rodeo-2-0-timeline-update/). Check out [owlbear-instant-summons](https://github.com/christian-doucette/owlbear-instant-summons) for an updated version.


Instant Summons is a Chrome extension that allows you to instantly summon (upload) monster tokens by name on the Owlbear Rodeo token tab. Just enter the name of an official DnD monster and click the button to upload.

### Spell
> Instant Summons
>
> Material component: a sapphire worth 1,000 gp
>
>You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an invisible mark on its surface and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.
>
>At any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item's name and crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.
